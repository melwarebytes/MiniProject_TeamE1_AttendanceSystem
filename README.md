# Student Attendance Management System (SAMS)

Software Engineering Mini-Project · PES University, Bengaluru

SAMS is a web-based attendance system. Faculty take attendance from a roster or a rotating QR code, students track their own attendance and request leave, and administrators get reports and a tamper-evident audit trail.
